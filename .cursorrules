Keep in mind that I am using SvelteKit, Svelte5 and TailwindCSS.
Please use tailwindcss for styling as much as possible.
Svelte5 use only runes mode, so no export let and stuff.
Svelte5 doesn't alow on:<event> syntax like on:mousedown or on:click they are instead replaced with onmousedown or onclick, if you need to use
stuff like preventDefault you can use the e.preventDefault() function within the function thats called on the event.
Just declaring a variable with let or const doesn't make it reactive, you need to use $state(<value>) syntax to make it reactive.
You can use context7 mcp if you need any docs of any kind only when required! (If you are unsure about svelte5)
You can use supabase mcp to access supabase directly for any database needs only when required!
pfeewicqoxkuwnbuxnoz is the supabase project id and Selfcrafted is the project name.
