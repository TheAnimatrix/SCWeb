PLANNING AREA:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- payment processing for 3d print request
- on quote, make a section available for user to select address and click pay now
- upon clicking pay :
    - requisites : [amount, request id, delivery address]
    - create a new razorpay order (instance.orders.create)
    - Reads the "PrintRequest" table to validate the request stage / amount and updates it with order id + delivery address
    - return orderid and amount to client
- on client side :
    - upon receiving orderid and amount :
        - Launch razorpay payment dialog
        - upon successful payment :
            - update the PrintRequest table with the order_id (same as previous step), payment_id, payment_signature
            - add purchase record to purchases table (status, method, id, signature, billing_address, shipping_address, client_id, print_request_id, amount)
            - redirect to user portal and show a success section on top of the page
        - upon failure :
            - redirect to user portal and show a failure section on top of the page ('/summary/failure/{print_request_id}/{response.error.metadata.order_id}')
